# Kavpack
A modpack that aims not to overturn the game but adds mechanics that help players during the game and increase the number of things that can kill you and your friends in a fun way!

## Recommended config
To improve compatibility between mods we recommend changing the configurations of these mods.

### I really need to to do it?
No, but do it if you don't want the same key to be mapped for two different actions.

### And how do I change these configurations?
Run the modded game at least once. Next, if you use r2modman, click on "Config editor" on the left menu and you will have all the configurations divided by mod.
